## What is TFT?

## What is Think Fast?
_"Shop refreshes are free until the end of this round. Traits and other augments do not benefit from these free shops."_

### What's so special about it?
One of the core aspects of making your army stronger is by combining multiple of the same unit into one. 
The most common way to obtain these units is through the shop.
Every round, the shop will offer 5 units to buy with gold. The units offered might not be what the player is after so they must spend 2 gold to refresh the shop to see a new **random** set of units offered. 

This augment allows the player to spend the scarce gold on buying units rather than investing it in shop refreshes which can be expensive.
In other words, the _faster_ the player can perform the necessary actions and process new information, the better they can utilise their economy to strength their army.

However, the chance of getting this specific augment is rare (TODO: Math) so many player do not get to practice this skill often. I myself have only picked this augment once in 100+ games.

# So what is thinkfaster?
An overly simplified imitation of the user interface and Think Fast augment from TFT. After an embarrissing display of skill when picking this augment, I decided to create this application to give players an environment to practice this rare scenario.
