# Background
## What is TFT?
TFT stands for Teamfight Tactics, which is a popular auto battler game mode within the video game League of Legends. In TFT, players assemble a team of champions and strategically position them on a board to battle against other players' teams. Each round, players earn gold, which they can use to purchase new champions or level up their existing ones. The game also features different item combinations and synergies that can greatly enhance a player's team. The goal of TFT is to be the last player standing by winning battles and eliminating opponents.

## What is Think Fast?
In TFT, combining units is a key strategy in TFT that allows players to upgrade their champions and gain an advantage in combat.
Combining units involves merging two or three identical units to create a more powerful version of that unit with a higher star level. This can be done by purchasing multiple copies of the same unit from the shop. The player can spend gold to refresh the shop in hopes of getting the desired champion(s).

In TFT, augments are gameplay modifiers that can be used to add variety to the game. Think Fast is an augment that does the following:
_"Shop refreshes are free until the end of this round. Traits and other augments do not benefit from these free shops."_

In other words, Think Fast allows the player improve their team's strength by bypassing their economy restrictions, provided that they have the mechanical skill to perform all the requried actions in the given timeframe.

# So what is thinkfaster?
The chance of getting this specific augment is rare so many player do not get to practice this skill often. Personally, I have only picked this augment once in 100+ games.

thinkfaster is an overly simplified imitation of the user interface and Think Fast augment from TFT. After an embarrissing display of skill when picking this augment, I decided to create this application to give players an environment to practice this rare scenario.
